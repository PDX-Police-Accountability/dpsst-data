# README

This repository holds publicly accessible data pulled the from [Oregon Criminal Justice Information Records Inquiry System (CJ IRIS)](https://www.bpl-orsnapshot.net/PublicInquiry_CJ/EmployeeSearch.aspx) pertaining to current and former members of the Portland Police Bureau.

CJ IRIS is one of many systems maintained by Oregon's [Department of Public Safety Standards & Training (DPSST)](https://www.oregon.gov/dpsst/pages/default.aspx).

Data is pulled from CJ IRIS daily and stored in two different formats in the officers directory: [markdown](./officers/markdown) and [yaml](./officers/yaml).

A [summary document](./officers/summary/officer-transcripts.md) is also created nightly with links to each officer's current transcript.
