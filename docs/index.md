Data on this site is pulled from [Oregon Criminal Justice Information Records Inquiry System (CJ IRIS)](https://www.bpl-orsnapshot.net/PublicInquiry_CJ/EmployeeSearch.aspx).

CJ IRIS is one of many systems maintained by Oregon's [Department of Public Safety Standards & Training (DPSST)](https://www.oregon.gov/dpsst/pages/default.aspx).

Currently, data is pulled daily from CJ IRIS for current and former employees of the Portland Police Bureau.

A current summary/roster of active and inactive PPB employees is [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/content/ppb-roster).
