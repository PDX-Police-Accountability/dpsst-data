This project holds publicly accessible data pulled from [Oregon Criminal Justice Information Records Inquiry System (CJ IRIS)](https://www.bpl-orsnapshot.net/PublicInquiry_CJ/EmployeeSearch.aspx).

CJ IRIS maintains certification and training data for current and former members of the Portland Police Bureau.

CJ IRIS is one of many systems maintained by Oregon's [Department of Public Safety Standards & Training (DPSST)](https://www.oregon.gov/dpsst/pages/default.aspx).

Officer transcripts are pulled from CJ IRIS daily and stored in multiple formats in the [officers](https://github.com/PDX-Police-Accountability/dpsst-data/officers) directory of the [dpsst-data repository](https://github.com/PDX-Police-Accountability/dpsst-data) in Github.

A current summary/roster of active and inactive PPB employees is [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/content/ppb-roster).
